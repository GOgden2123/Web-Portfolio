        <h4 class="projectIdea">What's the big <span class="projectHighlight">idea?</span></h4>
        <p class="projectDescription">Create a database with a topic of your choosing, using MySQL. The created database should have at least 20 insert statements/records and must be able to run at least 10 queries to bring back results.</p>
        <h4 class="startingOut"><span class="projectHighlight">Starting</span> Out</h4>
        <p class="projectDescription">I started to create the database by first deciding on a general theme or topic. I decided on the theme of a Marvel vs. DC Comics database. While this theme may not have been the most realistic or practical,  I felt it was something different for an SQL database, it was also something that I was interested in.  This database would include different characters from both comics and their different attributes allocated to a number system. </p>
        <h4 class="finishingUp"><span class="projectHighlight">Finishing</span> Up</h4>
        <p class="finalThoughts">Finishing up the newly created database, I then came up with 10 different queries to ask of the database and have it bring back the appropriate result. A few of the queries listed asked about certain characters with certain powers of with a certain letter in theri name. Running these specific queries also helped to show and strengthen knowledge of course material.  </p>
