        <h4 class="projectIdea">What's the big <span class="projectHighlight">idea?</span></h4>
        <p class="projectDescription">To design a new WordPress website for the CIT Department and incoming CIT students and document my work along the process. </p>
        <h4 class="startingOut"><span class="projectHighlight">Starting</span> Out</h4>
        <p class="projectDescription">I first began the site design by creating the new designs in Lucid Chart, then coding up the new site with HTML and CSS. After initially completing my HTML and CSS design, I then had the code turned into a WordPress theme using PHP.  </p>
        <h4 class="finishingUp"><span class="projectHighlight">Finishing</span> Up</h4>
        <p class="finalThoughts">After turning my code into a theme, I used the Elementor plugin within WordPress to craft the website and its different components. These different components consisted of the header, footer, having a look and feel like the actual live IUPUI school website. Lastly, I presented my final product to my peers and my clients. Both my clients were pleased with what I had created and both thought it was a big improvement and a good idea into what a new CIT website can look like for future consideration.</p>
